I'm not a fan of [[reinventing-the-wheel|reinventing the wheel]], thus, I've searched for the best libraries out there to help me make this website. Here are a few external libraries I used:

## Converting MD to HTML
- [obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export) (Obsidian MD -> [Common MD](https://commonmark.org/))
- [remarkjs](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) (Common MD -> HTML)
- [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) (HTML -> Beautiful HTML)

## Others:
- Obsidian Git to help with [[connect-obsidian-vault-with-github|publishing notes from within the Obsidian Vault]]
