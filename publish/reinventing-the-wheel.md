> In programming, the phrase "reinventing the wheel" refers to the act of writing code to implement a function or feature that already exists in a library or framework. For example, if a programmer writes a function to sort a list of numbers when there is already a sorting function available in the standard library, they would be said to be "reinventing the wheel."
